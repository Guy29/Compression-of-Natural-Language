\section{Natural language compilation}

\subsection{Montague grammar}
In 1970, logician Richard Montague posited that there is “no important theoretical difference between natural languages and the artificial languages of logicians” and that it is “possible to comprehend the syntax and semantics of both kinds of language within a single natural and mathematically precise theory.” \autocite{Montague1970_universal_grammar} and \autocite{Montague1970_english_formal}

Montague gives a grammar which can be used to parse English, and a specification for a parser based on this grammar is given by Friedman \& Warren \autocite{Friedman1978}.
