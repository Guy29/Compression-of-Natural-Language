\subsection{Known results}

In 2006, Hutter created a prize to “encourage development of intelligent compressors/programs as a path to AGI” \autocite{Hutter2006}. The challenge is to compress 1GB of text extracted from Wikipedia, chosen because “Wikipedia is an extensive snapshot of Human Knowledge. If you can compress the first 1GB of Wikipedia better than your predecessors, your (de)compressor likely has to be smart(er)” and explaining that “while intelligence is a slippery concept, file sizes are hard numbers.”

The prize is awarded based on improvements in data compression on a specific 1 GB text file, titled \texttt{enwik9}, which is extracted from the English Wikipedia.

The approaches taken by the record holders as well as the performance of their methods gives an indication of the current practical possibilities.
