# Final Year Project - Compression of natural language

## Description
The Hutter Prize is a cash prize funded by Marcus Hutter which rewards data compression improvements on a specific 1 GB English text file, with the goal of encouraging research in artificial intelligence (AI). The organizers believe that comprehension and compression of data are equivalent problems.

The aim of this project will be to examine approaches that past winners of the prize have implemented, and to find potential new approaches to the compression of natural language.
