#### Things to research, understand, and/or mention in report
- Introduction to Hutter's research, Kolmogorov complexity, AIXI, and Shannon entropy
- [This](https://aclanthology.org/2023.findings-acl.426/) paper
- How compression, comprehension, and abstraction relate. Touch on etymology.
- [Pierre Menard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Menard%2C_Author_of_the_Quixote)
- Use of "regularities" in the data
    - It is an XML file
    - The tree structure is repetitious
- Are inconsistencies like "I am eating a sandwich yesterday" in some way analogous to type errors in compilation?

#### Potential approaches
- Using parse trees to compile natural language. Syntactically or semantically incorrect phrases should either have no representation or a costly representation.
